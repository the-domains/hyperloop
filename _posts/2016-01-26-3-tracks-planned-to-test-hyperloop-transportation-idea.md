description: "LOS ANGELES (AP) - The race to build the world's first \"hyperloop\" is on. Three Southern California companies want to erect tracks to test how well the speed-of-sound transportation concept works in the real world. Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk breathed life into the hyperloop idea in 2013, when he proposed a network of elevated tubes to transport capsules of people or cargo over long distances."
